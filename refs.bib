abstract = {This paper introduces a new algorithm for the evaluation of monomials in two variables xayb based upon the continued fraction expansion of ab. A method for fast explicit generation of addition chains of small length for a positive integer n is deduced from this Algorithm. As an illustration of the properties of the method, a Scholz-Brauer-like inequality p(N) ≤ nb + k + p(n + 1), is shown to be true whenever N is an integer of the form 2k(1 + 2b + … + 2nb). Computer experimentation has shown that the length of the chains constructed are of optimal length for all integers up to 1000, with 29 exceptions for which the length is equal to the optimal length plus one.}

abstract="The fundamental operation in elliptic curve cryptographic schemes is the multiplication of an elliptic curve point by an integer. This paper describes a new method for accelerating this operation on classes of elliptic curves that have efficiently-computable endomorphisms. One advantage of the new method is that it is applicable to a larger class of curves than previous such methods. For this special class of curves, a speedup of up to 50{\%} can be expected over the best general methods for point multiplication.",
