## Title
Implementing Cryptographic Primitives in Lean 4

## Abstract
In this talk I will describe the experience of using Lean 4 as a fully-fledged programming language
to implement various number theoretic primitives used in cryptography. In particular, we will go 
through the examples of efficient implementations of finite field arithmetic, fast elliptic curve 
group operations, and some commonly used cryptographic hash functions. 

Along the way I plan on reflecting on the lessons learned in building structurally and
mathematically complex libraries in Lean 4. I will also cover some future directions and long-term
visions of Lean 4's place in modern cryptography.
